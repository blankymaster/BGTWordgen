#Word Generator (BGT Version)
Patrick Wilson
Look at the comments in the code if you want notes about the source code.

##How it works:
It will ask you for what file you would like to open with words_alpha.txt in there by default.
It will show a window that will say that it is generating words.
#WARNING:
This process takes a few minutes depending on how large the file is. The file that comes with this program takes about 2 minutes on my Mac Book Pro. This is a coding language limitation and I cannot do anything about it.
Press either escape or Alt+F4 to exit this window.
When done, it will show an alert box with the word, and after that a question asking if you want to copy that word to the clipboard.
###Credits:
The text file and the idea came from: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

I hope you enjoy this program, as I have enjoyed coding it for you.
